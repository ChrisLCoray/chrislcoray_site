## About this code
This is a repository for my own personal website. I bootstrapped it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in 2019, and I've since updated it as newer versions of React have come out. I finally decided to share the source code as a portfolio item. As of Q1 2024, I've been updating it with React 18 - converting class-based components to function-based, for example.

## NO LICENSE GRANTED
If you want to look at my code and do a copy/paste for individual items, cool, but since this is for my own site, I'm not licensing this for full redistribution. I'm stripping the pdfJS and other items from the source, so attempting to download and use this without knowing what you're doing is going to result in a broken mess.

## Framework and Libs used:
You can always check out the package.json, but for a quick-glance under the hood:

* React 18.2.0 - Meta's frontend library for building apps
* Bootstrap 5.3.3 - Bootstrap is a SCSS lib for creating uniform components and forms
* React-bootstrap 2.10.1 - Allows Bootstrap to be used on top of React with native-style components
* React-dom 18.2.0 - React pkg for working with DOM elements
* React-router-dom 6.22.2 - React routing, allows the app to flow like a website with routes and pages
* React-scripts 5.0.1 - Config scrips for Create-React-App. I think I used it to generate a few components a few years ago, but these days I just create from scratch.
