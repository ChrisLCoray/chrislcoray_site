            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">devices</span>Application Engineer</h4>
            <p>I've been writing code for the web since I was 17 years old, starting with basic HTML. I've worked in a variety of industries on different types of products in multiple programming languages. I've written APIs in PHP that interfaced with third party applications (Magento, WordPress, Shopify), offline-compatible apps using just HTML5/CSS/JS, SaaS apps for the auto industry in Angular/jQuery, apps that interfaced with hardware over MQTT in AngularJS and GO, and "display" apps that were meant as marketing showpieces, including 3D graphics in ThreeJS with D3 and jQuery.</p>

            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">show_chart</span>Marketer</h4>
            <p>I got my degree in Marketing from Southern Utah University. Marketing appealed to me because at its core, it is both analytical and creative. It incorporates basic levels of psychology while relying on data and research.</p>
            <p>I feel that my degree has stayed relevant in my time as an Application/Software Engineer. I've worked in Electronic Marketing with seasoned professionals, having discussions to make certain that the data they need is what my team was providing to them. I've set up digital campaigns in Salesforce and Google Analytics, and set up Google Ad and Facebook Ad campaigns.</p>
            <p>I've also worked for a digital marketing agency. I'm very familiar with SEO and best practices, as it is directly tied to semantic HTML in building websites or web applications.</p>
            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">keyboard</span>Writer</h4>
            <p>I have experience in writing articles, blog posts, and content for websites. As an application engineer, I've both written copy for marketing emails, and sites and applications, and acted as an editor and given tips and feedback to clients when they sent me copy with grammatical errors.</p>
            <p>I was previously a staff writer for <em>Sarcastic Gamer</em> ~2009-2010, mostly covering video game industry news with a comedic edge, and Fiction Fridays which were our own version of weekly April Fool's jokes.</p>
            <p>I was a co-founder and co-editor of the now-defunct e-zine <em>Quantum Fairy Tales</em>, an online speculative fiction e-zine with some writer friends of mine, and I submitted pieces occasionally as well. I've written one NaNoWriMo novel (<em>Under Umber Seas</em> - the first few chapters are up on
                <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/95118442-under-umber-seas-preview-chapter-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wattpad</a>), a Steampunk/Alt History Speculative Fiction novel set in a post-apocalyptic Europe, where humanity has taken to the skies for survival.</p>
            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">view_in_ar</span>3D Artist/Programmer</h4>
            <p>I grew up doing traditional media art as a kid - graphite and colored pencil, oil painting - and when I entered college, I started as an art student wanting to do 2D and 3D graphics for games, movies, etc. I ended up switching majors, but it's still something I enjoy doing in my spare time, as well as incorporating into my career when I can.</p>
            <p>More recently, with WebGPU being rolled out and companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have begun playing in AR spaces, I decided it was time to start re-building my 3D skills. I am a firm believer that when the market catches on to the power that AR can provide their applications, JavaScript developers with those skills will be in high demand.</p>
            <p>Part of that process has been re-learning Blender, the defacto open source software for creating 3D graphics and animations, and some of that time has been spent learning the in-software coding system for Meta's Metaverse.</p>
