            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">devices</span>Application Engineer</h4>
            <p>I've been writing code for the web since I was 17 years old, starting with basic HTML. I've worked in a variety of industries on different types of products in multiple programming languages. I've written APIs in PHP that interfaced with third party applications (Magento, WordPress, Shopify), offline-compatible apps using just HTML5/CSS/JS, SaaS apps for the auto industry in Angular/jQuery, apps that interfaced with hardware over MQTT in AngularJS and GO, and "display" apps that were meant as marketing showpieces, including 3D graphics in ThreeJS with D3 and jQuery.</p>

            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">view_in_ar</span>3D Artist/Programmer</h4>
            <p>I grew up doing traditional media art as a kid - graphite and colored pencil, oil painting - and when I entered college, I started as an art student wanting to do 2D and 3D graphics for games, movies, etc. I ended up switching majors, but it's still something I enjoy doing in my spare time, as well as incorporating into my career when I can.</p>
            <p>More recently, with WebGPU being rolled out and companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have begun playing in AR spaces, I decided it was time to start re-building my 3D skills. I am a firm believer that when the market catches on to the power that AR can provide their applications, JavaScript developers with those skills will be in high demand.</p>
            <p>Part of that process has been re-learning Blender, the defacto open source software for creating 3D graphics and animations, and some of that time has been spent learning the in-software coding system for Meta's Metaverse. In late 2022/early 2023, Meta announced that they planned to roll out the Metaverse platform to WebGPU, which would make it accessible to all VR devices and a browser-based portal (probably accessible through Facebook), increasing the potential audience and ad revenue. More recently (as of Feb. 2024), Meta has added the ability for content creators to use tri-mesh (video game quality) 3D models to be imported through a Facebook Dev account. While we're still a ways off from a more unified platform, it's a big step closer and adds a lot more creative freedom, as well as allowing content creators in that space like myself to optimize our builds better.</p>
            <h4><span className="material-symbols-outlined">keyboard</span>Writer</h4>
            <p>I was previously a staff writer for <em>Sarcastic Gamer</em> ~2009-2010, mostly covering video game
                industry news with a comedic edge, and Fiction Fridays which were our own version of weekly April Fool's jokes.
                I was a co-founder and editor of the now-defunct e-zine <em>Quantum Fairy Tales</em>, an online speculative fiction
                e-zine with some writer friends of mine, and I submitted pieces occasionally as well. I've written one NaNoWriMo novel
                (<em>Under Umber Seas</em> - the first few chapters are up on
                <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/95118442-under-umber-seas-preview-chapter-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wattpad</a>),
                a Steampunk/Alt History Speculative Fiction novel set in a post-apocalyptic Europe where modernization happened much
                more quickly and with much more devastating consequences to the environment.</p>
